      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>A DATA SCIENCE ENTHUSIAST AND JUNIOR MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER 
        A competent, determined, and bilingual person well-versed in data science concepts focusing on machine learning; data modeling, data pre-processing, model training, and data visualization with libraries like sci-kit learn, NumPy, matplotlib, and pandas. I also assist front-end users with a diverse computer system, mobile device, and peripheral equipment problems together with security standards and usability optimization. 
        Effectively operate autonomously to troubleshoot and fix concerns.  
        I have a clear, logical mind with a practical approach to problem-solving and a drive to see things through to completion. Teamwork is my strong suit; I actively seek to develop long-lasting relationships with my co-workers and clients.
